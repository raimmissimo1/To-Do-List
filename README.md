# To-Do-List
📝 To-Do List (Python Project)

This is a simple console-based To-Do List application written in Python.
It allows users to create, view, and remove their daily tasks easily through a text-based menu.

🚀 Features

View all your current tasks

Add new tasks

Remove completed or unnecessary tasks

Exit safely when done

(Optional) Save tasks to a file for persistence

💡 How It Works

When you start the program, you’ll see a menu with 4 options:

See your To-Do List

Add a new task

Remove a task

Exit

The program runs in a while loop until you choose Exit.

All tasks are stored in a Python list (to_do_list).
